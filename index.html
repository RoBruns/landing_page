                <h2>Broken Planet</h2>
                <p>The best brand of all, both in terms of beauty and quality, with a unique identity where, even if your name isn't written on it, you already know it's from them. In addition to all this, the brand has an institute focused on caring for the environment, where its garments range from 100% organic cotton to biodegradable plastic packaging.</p>

                <h2>Revenge</h2>
                <p>Brand inspired by rapper xxxtentacion. Revenge gained notoriety, unfortunately with the death of the rapper. With a darker footprint, the brand brings this dark air to its pieces, and in this respect it stands out from the rest.</p>

                <h2>Golf le Fleur</h2>
                <p>A brand developed by Tyler the creator, which carries all the essence of the rapper and producer, not least because he is the brand's main designer. Tyler is the ultimate reference for style, for setting trends and he brings all this to Golf, which makes this brand incredible and unique.</p>

            <div class="intro-text-content">
                <h2>Piet</h2>
                <p>The best national brand, its pieces are totally off the beaten track, but remain on trend. It's because of this exclusivity that the brand stands out. Passing itself off as a foreign brand but with a Brazilian touch in its pieces, simply incredible.</p>

            <div class="text-color-primary">
                <h2>Corteiz</h2>
                <p>British brand, focused on London street fashion, and what strikes me about them is the fact that they do it so well, taking all the essence of European streetwear and stamping their brand on the pieces. Basically what Supreme did in New York, they took and made better in London.</p>
